I solved the halting problem, it doesn't exist.
Just check every n + 1 clock cycles whether the
previous savestate (a term from speedrunning)
matches the current savestate exactly, byte for
byte. You can discard the previous previous savestate.

n can be a arbitrary precision integer.

You add 1 to n every time you check.

Now where's my million dollars for proving P=NP...

I dedicate this idea to the Public Domain.
