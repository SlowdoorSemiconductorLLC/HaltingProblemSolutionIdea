I solved the halting problem, it doesn't exist.
Just check every n + 1 clock cycles whether the
previous savestate (a term from speedrunning)
matches the current savestate exactly, byte for
byte. You can discard the previous previous savestate.

n can be a arbitrary precision integer.

You add 1 to n every time you check.

Also, halting problem is only unsolvable with my algorithm if there exists infinite tape, which doesn't exist in reality.

Also, my algorithm detects all infinite loops, but some infinite loops may be whitelisted like the OS kernel.

Now where's my million dollars for proving P=NP...
